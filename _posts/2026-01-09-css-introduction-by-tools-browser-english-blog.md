# 🎨 CSS — The look, beauty and personality of a website

Imagine —  
There is a person with no clothes, no style, no color.  
That is exactly how a website looks if **CSS does not exist**.

HTML is the **structure (skeleton)** of a website  
CSS is the **shape, color, style and beauty** of that structure ✨

## 📜 The birth of CSS (History)

In the early 1990s when the web was being created, everything was done using HTML —  
colors, fonts, borders, alignment.

But the problem was —

> One website had 100 pages  
> To change the colors of all of them  
> you had to edit 100 different files 😫

To solve this, in 1996 **Håkon Wium Lie** created —

> **CSS – Cascading Style Sheets**

After that, design became separate,  
content became separate,  
and the web became more powerful.

## 🤔 Why is CSS needed?

Imagine you are building a house —

| Item | Real world | Web world |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Structure | Bricks, cement | HTML |
| Color, paint | Decoration | CSS |
| Furniture | Table, chair | CSS Layout |

HTML tells  
**what exists**

CSS tells  
**how it looks**
