  and life to websites. Learn CSS in English.

# 🎨 CSS --- The look, beauty and personality of a website

Imagine --- A person with no clothes, no style, no color. That is how a
website looks if **CSS does not exist**.

HTML is the **skeleton (structure)** of a website.\
CSS is the **color, style, and beauty** of that structure ✨

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📜 The birth of CSS (History)

In the early 1990s, everything was done using HTML --- colors, fonts,
borders, alignment.

The problem was ---

> A website had 100 pages\
> To change colors you had to edit 100 files 😫

To solve this, in 1996 **Håkon Wium Lie** created ---

> **CSS -- Cascading Style Sheets**

Design became separate, content became separate, and the web became
powerful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🤔 Why is CSS needed?

Imagine building a house ---

  Item            Real World       Web World
  --------------- ---------------- ------------
  Structure       Bricks, cement   HTML
  Color & paint   Decoration       CSS
  Furniture       Table, chair     CSS Layout

HTML tells **what exists**\
CSS tells **how it looks**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌍 How does a website look without CSS?

-   No colors\
-   No beautiful buttons\
-   No layout\
-   Plain text

Just a boring notebook-like page 📄

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 What can CSS do?

-   Change colors 🎨\
-   Resize text 🔠\
-   Round images 🖼️\
-   Hover effects\
-   Mobile layout\
-   Dark mode\
-   Animations\
-   Cards\
-   Navigation bars\
-   App‑like design

Facebook, YouTube, Amazon --- all beauty comes from **CSS**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧬 Full form of CSS

**CSS = Cascading Style Sheets**

  Word        Meaning
  ----------- ---------------
  Cascading   Ordered rules
  Style       Design
  Sheets      Separate file

Meaning: Design rules in a separate file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏗️ Where is CSS used?

-   Websites\
-   Android WebView\
-   Desktop Apps\
-   Chrome Extensions\
-   Game UI\
-   Blogs\

## 🧪 Real life example

Think of a shop ---

  Item                  HTML   CSS
  --------------------- ------ -----
  Shop name             ✔      ❌
  Product list          ✔      ❌
  Decoration            ❌     ✔
  Lighting & colors     ❌     ✔
  Highlighting offers   ❌     ✔

HTML builds the shop\
CSS decorates it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 Without CSS

-   Users lose interest\
-   Website looks boring\
-   Mobile view breaks\
-   Brand value drops

A good website = **HTML + CSS + JS**
